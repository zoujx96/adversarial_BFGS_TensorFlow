# adversarial_TensorFlow

Having searched the whole Github Library, I could not find even an existing code for creating adversarial examples under TensorFlow in Python. To achieve more convenient use of code for the developers and researchers who are working on adversarial machine learning or related fields, and to seek for more efficient implementation of existing adversarial examples creating algorithms, I developed an API for creating adversarial examples based on BFGS algorithm. The algorithm uses TensorFlow Graph so the code should be run on GPUs. The code could be used on different datasets and different neural network models.

This repository consists of two files: adversarial.py and sourcef.py.
